4.1 Business Integration
? Business currently is a world of M&A
? companies need to diversify/enhance their portfolio ? but it is expensive to develop necessary applications
? knowledge gathering costs time ? will the output be worth it?

? idea: rely on people who are already knowledgeable
? acquire small, specialized, and promising companies ? merge with big players in the field

4.1 Business Integration
? Examples
? the Daimler-Chrysler merger ? the Oracle-Sun merger ? Oracle buys PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems, BEA Systems, ?
? Siebel Sales as CRM tool now part of Oracle?s business intelligence suite

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

4

4.1 Business Integration
? Merged (parts of) businesses are administrated by
? different specialized software systems? ? one company-wide system?

? Usually there is an historical evolution of separate tools and programs
? e.g. accounting, sales & marketing, development ? based on individual requirements

? However, often a unified view is needed
? e.g. for business intelligence and warehousing
? Data Warehousing is also a great lecture at ifis?

5

4.1 View Integration
? Usually, there are several conceptual schemas
? several designers are part of the modeling process (modular software development) ? different tasks were modeled within the same organization (legacy systems) ? several organizations need to be integrated (business integration)

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

4.1 View Integration
? View Integration
? several conceptual schemas need to be combined into a unified global schema ? all differences in perspective and terminology have to be resolved ? all redundancy has to be removed

? But,? what happens, if you don?t integrate?!

4.1 The Mars Desaster
? Example: Big NASA project Mars Surveyor
? the 1998 missions investigated Volatiles and Climate History on Mars
? characterization of climate change and its evolving impact on the distribution of water ? idea: explore the polar ice caps of Mars and see whether there is water ice ? about three months of experiments on Mars were scheduled

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

8

4.1 The Mars Desaster
? Two vehicles: Mars climate orbiter and Mars polar lander
? the lander was supposed to probe the layers of ice and dust on the polar ice caps to investigate changes ? the orbiter was built to monitor the daily weather and record changes in water vapor and dust in the atmosphere
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

9

4.1 The Mars Desaster
? Catastrophic failure
? the Mars climate orbiter approached Mars up to 57 km instead of 150 km, and was destroyed in the atmosphere on September 23, 1999 ? the Mars polar lander crashed during its attempted landing on Mars, December 3, 1999 ? $327.6 million in total for both
? $193.1 million for spacecraft development $ 91.7 million for launch $ 42.8 million for mission operations

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

10

4.1 The Mars Desaster
? Why did the climate orbiter come too close to Mars? atmosphere?
? many organizations were involved in the development ? there was no global schema
? navigation software produced by Lockheed Martin used non-metric units (i.e. inches, feet, and pounds) ? NASA used metric units ? a small correction of the course led to the fatally low orbit?
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

11

4.1 The Mars Desaster
? Happy ending!
? the next try was the successful 2001 Mars Odyssey ? the measurements pointed to water ice on Mars ? confirmed by the Mars Express (ESA) in 2004
? the polar caps consist of 85% carbon dioxide (CO2) ice and 15% water ice

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

12

4.1 The Mars Desaster
? In 2012 Curiosity landed on Mars
? Investigation of climate and geology ? Did the surface of Mars ever offer conditions favorable for microbial life?
? Investigation of the role of water

? Planetary habitability studies in preparation for future human exploration

4.2 Resolving Incompatibilities
? Schema diversity occurs when different users develop their own understanding of the world
? the same reality is not always modeled in the same way due to different information needs or workflows

? Common principle for schema integration
? identify the parts of the input schemas that represent the same reality ? unify their representations

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

15

4.2 Basic Steps
? There are four basic steps needed for conceptual schema integration
1. 2. 3. 4. pre-integration analysis comparison of schemas conformation of schemas merging and restructuring of schemas

? The integration process needs continual refinement and reevaluation

17

4.2 Pre-Integration Analysis
? Pre-integration analysis takes a close look on the individual conceptual schemas to decide for an adequate integration strategy
? the larger the number of constructs, the more important is modularization ? is it really sensible/possible to integrate all schemas?

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

18

4.2 Pre-Integration Analysis
? First, an integration strategy has to be chosen ? Schema integration can either be performed many at a time, ?
? requires only one consistent merge ? conflict analysis from many schemas is difficult ? may conserve efforts if done well

4.2 Comparison of Schemas
? The resolution of conflicts needs a thorough comparison of schemas
? general question: how do entities correspond? ? naming conflicts can be detected, e.g. by scanning the data dictionary ? structural conflicts regarding semantics have to be resolved
? different cardinalities in relationships ? key conflicts ??
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

21

4.2 Comparison of Schemas
? The individual perspective of the world and the level of abstraction are major reasons for conceptual incompatibilities
? Example
? A product is a unit of sale for the marketing department, but consists of parts in the view of the engineering department.

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

22

4.2 Comparison of Schemas
? The level of abstraction directly influences the schema design ? Simple example: A customer buys a product ? The marketing view focuses on how many people buy some product, e.g., for advertising
? only the characteristics of the customer and product and the connection are needed
Customer (0,*) orders (0,*) Product

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

23

4.2 Comparison of Schemas
? The accounting view also needs the exact order number for identification of individual customer transactions
? focus is on the purchase, but individual orders have to be distinguished
order-no Customer (0,*) purchases (0,*) Product

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

24

4.2 Comparison of Schemas
? The sales view needs all individual order details, e.g., for troubleshooting or CRM
? focus is on orders (which provide the basis for purchase contracts)
Customer (0,*) places (1,1) Order (0,*) for (1,1) Product

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

25

4.2 Comparison of Schemas

? Accounting

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

26

4.2 Comparison of Schemas
? Different user groups use different names to refer to the same entities (differing terminology)
? synonyms: two terms for the same entity ? homonym: the same term for different entities

? Rule of thumb: eliminate synonyms, rename homonyms!

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

27

4.2 Conformation of Schemas
? The main goal is to make schemas compatible for integration ? Conformation usually needs manual interaction
? conflicts need to be resolved semantically ? rename entities/attributes ? convert differing types, e.g. schema 1 convert an entity to an attribute or a relationship ? align cardinalities/functionalities schema 3 ? align different data types

schema 2

schema 4

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

28

4.2 Conformation of Schemas
? Besides renaming and type conversions, abstraction can be useful
? generalization and aggregation allows to create new supertypes or subtypes

? Also assertions and constraints must be generalized or distributed among the type hierachy
? for example, checking accounts and saving accounts are both types of accounts, but may differ with respect to the minimum balance constraint
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

29

4.2 Conformation of Schemas
? Example: Resolving differing terminology ? Homonyms: Schema 1 and 2 both contain the term jaguar, but mean different entities
? Rename to jaguar_car and jaguar_animal

? Synonyms: Schema 1 contains the term jaguar, whereas schema 2 contains the term panther
? global schema should model panther is_a jaguar ? constraint on the black color should be added
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

30

4.2 Merging and Restructuring
? How to merge schemas into a global schema?
? copy all distinct entities from the individual schemas ? apply renaming, overlapping entity integration, abstraction, attribute type conversions, etc. ? put in the distinct relationships from all schemas ? again use renaming, cardinality/functionality conversions, etc. ? restructure the resulting global schema

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

31

4.2 Merging and Restructuring
? The final restructuring of the schema is driven by the goal of completeness, minimality, and ease of understanding
? completeness mandates that all concepts in the global schema appear semantically intact
? all different concepts of every individual schema are also part of the global schema ? for each concept, there are no missing attributes, no constraints that cannot be met by all members of a type, etc.

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

32

4.2 Merging and Restructuring
? minimality enforces to remove all redundant concepts from the global schema
? e.g. overlapping entities or redundant relationships ? often, the question of minimality can only be decided semantically
Customer Customer

shops in

not redundant
lives in

buys in

Shop

City

33

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

4.2 Merging and Restructuring
? ease of understanding means that the global schema makes sense to the users
? in particular, abstraction and fine granular levels for entities can be very confusing ? Example: Subtype entities have to be clearly distinguishable, and should have only attributes that are not inherited from the supertype.

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

34

4.2 Example: View Integration ? Doomsday Legion (DDL)
? cooperation of villains from all over the world striving for global domination ? channeling resources, staff, experience and power for reaching their goals ? centralized and coordinated management of all shared assets
? ? ? ? lairs minions assault squads ?

? great problem: joining large organizations is not that easy
? beside the problem of ignoring old hatred, the data schemas need to be integrated for central mission control and planning

47

4.2 Outlook
? View integration is a semantic process
? this usually means a lot of manual work ? computers can support the process by matching some (parts of) schemas

? There have been some approaches towards (semi-)automatic matching of schemas
? matching is a complex process and usually only focuses on simple constructs like Are two entities semantically equivalent? ? the result is still rather error-prone?
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

48

4.2 Outlook
? Basic methods (that can of course be mixed freely)
? label-based matching
? for each label in one schema, consider all labels of the other schema and every time gauge their semantic similarity

? instance-based matching
? looking at the instances (of entities or relationships) one can e.g. find correlations between attributes Are there duplicate tuples? or Are the data distributions in their respective domains similar?

? structure-based matching
? abstracting from the actual labels, only the structure of the schema is evaluated, e.g. regarding element types, depths in hierarchies, number and type of relationships
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

49

4.2 Outlook
? Sometimes schema integration is query-driven
? the integration is only needed in order to query several different information sources having different schemas

? In that case only a schema mapping is needed
? basically the mapping is a list of correspondences between equivalent entities or relationships of heterogeneous schemas ? the query can then be translated for each different schema using the mapping ? the mapping can be derived manually or automatically from a respective matching

4.3 Entity Clustering
? When multiple schemas are merged, global schema can become very large
? many different entities and relationships between them
? e.g. global view of a company with all its dependencies

? but some parts from different views are entirely independent
? e.g. accounting does not need technical specifications of products

? Idea: Cluster semantically coherent parts and abstract from their actual entities in the global schema
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

4.3 Clustering Concepts
? Grouping is an operation that combines entities and their relationships to form higher-level constructs
? groups are called entity clusters ? can also be performed hierarchically from the entire database (root entity cluster) over several levels down to the individual entities
? all original entities are on clustering level 1

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

55

4.3 Clustering Concepts
? Usually, entity clusters are depicted similar to normal entities in ER diagrams
? by a dark-bordered box ? numbered according to the clustering level and an identifier ? interfaces for Shop 2.1 inter-cluster Branch relationships sells have to be Item annotated Product 2.2

4.3 Grouping Operations
? Grouping operations are the fundamental components of entity clustering
? all operations are heuristic in nature

? Often occurring operations are
? dominance grouping ? abstraction grouping ? constraint grouping ? relationship grouping

? They can be applied recursively or in a variety of combinations to produce higher level clusters
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

57

4.3 Grouping Operations
? Dominance grouping focuses on semantically dominant entities in the ER diagrams
? hubs for otherwise unconnected or weak entities

?

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

4.3 Grouping Operations
? Abstraction grouping clusters entities of a specific super-type
? especially helpful, if subclassses have no individual relationships ? ?

? ?
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

59

4.3 Grouping Operations
? Constraint grouping clusters entities related by the same constraint
? e.g. integrity constraints such as XOR constraints ? ?

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

60

4.3 Grouping Operations
? Relationship grouping focuses on ternary or higher-degree relationships
? the relationship is represented as a whole
?

?

?

?
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

61

4.3 Clustering Technique
? Identify all major functional areas and subareas in a top down analysis
? functional areas are often defined during the requirement analysis as important organizational units (e.g. HR or R&D) or business activities ? usually there will be a certain degree of overlap, for example employee data will be administrated by HR, but may also be needed in other departments

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

62

4.3 Clustering Technique
? The actual clustering has four steps
? define points of grouping within each functional area
? locate dominant entities, consider abstraction, find n-ary or constrained relationships, etc. ? if such points do not exist, consider grouping the entire area

? form entity clusters
? use the basic grouping operations on elementary entities and their relationships to form higher level clusters ? since entities might belong to several clusters, define priorities like always prefer abstraction grouping, avoid crossing boundaries of functional areas, or leave entities ungrouped, if they belong to two or more groups at the same level of precedence
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Institut f?r Informationssysteme ? TU Braunschweig

63

4.3 Clustering Technique
? form higher level entity clusters
? apply the grouping operations recursively to any combination of elementary entities and entity clusters ? stop, if the diagram?s complexity is sufficiently low: This defines the root entity cluster

? validate the cluster diagram
? check for consistency of the interfaces (relationships) between entities or entity clusters at each level of the diagram ? verify the meaning of each level with the intended users

4.4 The BEA Story
? BEA AquaLogic Data Services
? special Feature: easy-to-use modeling
? In an SOA environment, a data model must be flexible so that it can represent any complex entity and rich enough to provide information about data structure, relationships, and services to read or update. ? Data services are illustrated in model diagrams and can easily be shared with others in the enterprise for greater data consistency and reuse. ? Mappings and transformations can be designed in an easy-to-use GUI tool using a library of over 200 functions. For complex mappings and transformations, architects and developers can bypass the GUI tool and use an XQuery source code editor to define or edit services.
