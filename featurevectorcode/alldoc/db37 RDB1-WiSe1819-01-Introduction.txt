1.1 What is a Database?
? Managing large amounts of data is an integral part of most nowadays business and governmental activities
? collecting taxes ? bank account management ? bookkeeping ? airline reservations ? human resource management ??
EN 1.1 Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

20

1.1 What is a Database?
? Databases are needed to manage that vast amount of data ? A database (DB) is a collection of related data
? represents some aspects of the real world
? universe of discourse

? data is logically coherent ? is provided for an intended group of users and applications
EN 1.1 Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

21

1.1 What is a Database?
? As for today, the database industry is one of the most successful branches of computer science
? constantly growing since the 1960s ? more than $8 billion revenue per year ? DB systems found in nearly any application ? ranging from large commercial transaction-processing systems to small open-source systems for your Web site
EN 1.1 Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

22

1.1 What is a Database?
? Databases are maintained by using a collection of programs called a database management system (DBMS), that deals with
? definition of data and structure ? physical construction ? manipulation ? sharing/protecting ? persistence/recovery

1.2 Characteristics of DBs
? Databases control redundancy
? same data used by different applications or tasks is stored only once ? access via a single interface provided by DBMS ? redundancy only purposefully used to speed up data access (e.g. materialized views)

? Problems of uncontrolled redundancy
? updating data may result in inconsistent data

EN 1.6.1

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

29

1.2 Characteristics of DBs
? Databases are well-structured (e.g. ER model)
? simple banking system
id number
has

firstname
lastname

customer
address

account
type

balance

? Relational Databases provide
? catalog (data dictionary) contains all meta data ? defines the structure of the data in the database
EN 1.3 Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

30

1.2 Characteristics of DBs
? Databases support declarative querying
? just specify what you want, not how and from where to get it ? queries are separated and abstracted from the actual physical organization and storage of data

? Get the firstname of all customers with lastname Smith
? file system: trouble with physical organization of data
? ? Load file c:\datasets\customerData.csv. Build a regular expression and iterate over lines: If 2nd word in line equals Smith, then return 1st word. Stop when end-of-file marker is reached. SELECT firstname FROM data WHERE lastname=?Smith?
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

?

? database system: simply query

31

1.2 Characteristics of DBs
? Databases aim at efficient manipulation of data
? physical tuning allows for good data allocation ? indexes speed up search and access ? query plans are optimized to improve performance

1.2 Characteristics of DBs
? Isolation between applications and data
? database employs data abstraction by providing data models ? applications work only on the conceptual representation of data
? Data is strictly typed (Integer, Float, Timestamp, Varchar, ?) ? Details on where data is actually stored and how it is accessed are hidden by the DBMS ? Applications can access and manipulate data by invoking abstract operations (e.g. SQL statements)

? DBMS-controlled parts of the file system are protected against external manipulations (tablespaces)

1.2 Characteristics of DBs
? Supports multiple views of the data
? views provide a different perspective of the DB
? a user?s conceptual understanding or task-based excerpt of the data (e.g. aggregations) ? security considerations and access control (e.g. projections)

? for applications, a view does not differ from a table ? views may contain subsets of a DB and/or contain virtual data
? virtual data is derived from the DB (mostly by simple SQL statements, e.g. joins over several tables) ? can either be computed at query time or materialized upfront

1.2 Characteristics of DBs
? Sharing of data and support for atomic multi-user transactions
? transactions are a series of database operations executed as one logical operation ? concurrency control is necessary for maintaining consistency
? multiple users and applications may access the DB at the same time

? transactions need to be atomic and isolated from each other
EN 1.3 Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

38

1.2 Characteristics of DBs
? Example: Atomic transactions
? Program: Transfer x Euros from Account 1 to Account 2
1. Debit amount x from Account 1 2. Credit amount x to Account 2

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

39

1.2 Characteristics of DBs
? Example: Atomic transactions
? Program: Transfer x Euros from Account 1 to Account 2
1. Debit amount x from Account 1 2. Credit amount x to Account 2

? But what happens if the system fails after performing the first step?

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

40

1.2 Characteristics of DBs
? Example: multi-user transactions
? Program: Withdraw x Euros from Account 1
1. Read old balance from DB 2. Set new balance to old balance ? x 3. Write new balance back to the DB

? Problem: Dirty Read
? Account 1 has ?500 ? User 1 deduces ?20 ? User 2 deduces ?80 at the same time

? Without multi-user transactions, Account 1 will have either ?480 or ?420, but not the correct ?400
? Both users read old value of ?500 simultaneously, both deduce either ?20 or ?80, both write back new value (in random order)
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

41

1.2 Characteristics of DBs
? Persistence of data and disaster recovery
? data needs to be persistent and accessible at all times ? quick recovery from system crashes without data loss ? recovery from natural disasters (fire, earthquake, ?)

1.2 Database Users
? Usually several groups of persons are involved in the daily usage of a large DBMS (many job opportunities for smart DB people?) ? Persons directly involved on DB level
? Database Administrators
? responsible for tuning and maintaining the DBMS ? management of storage space, security, hardware, software, etc.

? Database Designers
? identify the data that needs to be stored and chooses appropriate data structures and representations ? integrate the needs of all users into the design
EN 1.4 Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

1.3 History of DBs
? Tabulating machines
? operations or ?programs? directed by a plug board ? up to 150 cards per minute ? results were printed or punched for input to other processing steps

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

51

1.3 History of DBs
? In 1951 IBM develops the electric UNIVAC 1
? first commercial computer produced in the USA
? programmable (turing complete) ? input (programs and data) with tape or punched cards

? In 1959, USA dominated the (still highly active) punch card machine market
? within the USA, the Pentagon alone used more than 200 data processing computers, costing $70 million per year
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

52

1.3 History of DBs
? In 1964, the term data base appeared for the first time in military computing using time sharing systems
? data could be shared among users ? but data was still bound to one specific application
? similar data needed by multiple applications had to be duplicated ? consistency problems when updating data

? data structure highly-dependent on the hardware and (low-level) programming language used
? inspired by punch cards and optimized for magnetic tapes ? usually, no relationships between different records have been stored, just plain data
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

53

1.3 History of DBs
? To turn stored data into a proper database, the following goals had to be achieved (McGee, 1981):
? Data Consolidation
? data must be stored in a central place, accessible to all applications ? knowledge about relationships between records must be represented

? Data Independence
? data must be independent of the specific quirks of the particular low level programming language used ? provide high-level interfaces to physical data storage

? Data Protection
? data must be protected against loss and abuse
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

54

1.3 History of DBs
? Data Consolidation motivated the development of data models
? ? ? ? ? Hierarchical Data Model Network Data Model Relational Data Model Object-oriented Data Model Semantic Data Model

? Data Independence inspired the development of query models and high-level languages
? Relational Algebra, SQL

? Data Protection led to development of transactions, backup schemes, and security protocols
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

55

1.3 History of DBs
? Hierarchical Data Model
? first appearance in IBM?s IMS database system, designed for the Apollo Program in 1966
? still, as of 2006, 95% of all Fortune 1000 companies use IBM IMS in their data backbone?

? benefits from advances in hardware design
? random access main memory and tape media available

Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

56

1.3 History of DBs
? Hierarchical data model
? each type of record has some defined structured data ? hierarchical one-to-many relationships

1.3 History of DBs
? Network Data Model
? in the mid-1960th, direct access storage devices (DASD) gained momentum
? primarily hard disks ? more complex storage schemes possible

? Hierarchical Data Model failed, e.g. for bill-of-material-processing (BOMP)
? many-to-many relationships needed ? development of the IBM DBOMP system (1960)

? result: Network Data Model
? two types of files: master files, chain files ? chain file entries could chain master file entry to one another
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

58

1.3 History of DBs
? Network Data Model
? the model was standardized by Charles W. Bachman for the CODASYL Consortium in 1969
? CODASYL = Conference of Data Systems Languages ? thus, also called the CODASYL model

? allowed for more natural modeling of associations

? Advantages
? many-to-many-relationships

? Disadvantages
? no declarative queries ? queries must state the data access path
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

59

1.3 History of DBs
? The relational data model ? Published by Edgar F. ?Ted? Codd in 1970, after several years of work
? A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks, Communications of the ACM, 1970 ? employee of IBM Research
? IBM ignored his idea for a long time as not being ?practical? while pushing it?s hierarchical IMS database system ? other researchers in the field also rejected his theories ? finally, he received the Turing Award in 1981
Relational Database Systems 1 ? Wolf-Tilo Balke ? Technische Universit?t Braunschweig

60

1.3 History of DBs
? Idea underlying the relational model:
? database is seen as a collection of predicates over a finite set of predicate variables
? example
? dislikes(x, y) ? dislikes(?Ted Codd?, ?hierarchical IMS database system?) (TRUE) ? dislikes(?IBM?, ?hierarchical IMS database system?) (FALSE)

? the set of all true assignments is called a relation ? relations are stored in tables

? contents of the DB are a collection of relations ? queries are also predicates
? queries and data are very similar ? Allows for declarative querying

62

1.3 History of DBs
? Beginning 1977, Lawrence J. Ellison picked up the idea and created Oracle DB (currently in version 12c)
? and became insanely rich ? long time in the Top 10 of the richest people ? in 2015 Oracle ranked second on the list of largest software companies in the world, right after Microsoft

64

1.3 History of DBs
? During the 1970s, IBM had also decided to develop a relational database system
? System R with the first implementation of the SQL declarative query language (SEQUEL) ? at first, mostly a research prototype, later became the base for IBM DB2

? Ingres Database was developed at UC Berekeley as a research project
? It became PostgreSQL in 1996
