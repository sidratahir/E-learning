• Without Web search, content cannot be found – Why create online content if nobody will read it? – Only for very popular topics, Web search can be replaced by Web directories like DMOZ
• Without Web search, there would be less collaboration – How to find people with similar interests and problems? – What open source projects would be possible without Web search? What about the Social Web?
• Without Web search, bills cannot be paid – Infrastructure, servers, and content cost a lot of money – This is largely paid by search ads
Web Search is Essential

Heterogeneity of Document Types
12Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• Web search engines are used for different purposes and within different contexts • There are four main types of queries: – Informational queries: Find general information about some topic, e.g., “Web search” – Navigational queries: Find a specific website, e.g., “Facebook” – Transactional queries: Find websites providing some service, e.g., “Adobe Reader download” – Connectivity queries: Find connected pages, e.g., “link:www.tu-bs.de” (finds all pages that link to http://www.tu-bs.de)
Heterogeneity of Queries

Two different topics?
• How many queries a search engine has to process? • Here are some numbers from 2005:
• 700 queries per second are… – …around 60 million queries per day – …around 22 billion queries per year • Today, it’s definitely much more than 700 queries…
Number of Queries

Average number of queries per second Google 700 Yahoo 600 MSN 300 AOL 180
• How large is a typical Web search engine’s index? • Here are some recent estimates from worldwidewebsize.com
? Both Yahoo and Ask have stopped showing their total number of results, so no recent estimates are available. • By the way: Where did they get these numbers from?
Index Size
19Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
Number of indexed Web pages Google (January 2014) ~15,000,000,000,000 Bing (January 2014) ~9,000,000,000,000 Yahoo (June 2010) 50,000,000,000 Ask (June 2010) 1,700,000,000
• The authors of worldwidewebsize.com describe their estimation method as follows:
– Obtain word frequencies from a large offline text collection • More than 1 million web pages from DMOZ • Can be considered a representative sample of the World Wide Web
– Send 50 randomly chosen words to the search engine • “Randomly” = selected evenly across logarithmic frequency intervals
– For each word, record the number of Web pages found
– Estimate the index size using these numbers by exploiting the relative word frequencies of the background corpus
Index Size: Estimation
20Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• When operating a search engine, you need a crawler • The crawler must continuously feed the indexer with new or updated information – New Web pages – Deleted Web pages – Updated Web pages • How much data must be transferred for doing this? • Some recent numbers from netcompetition.org: – Within the US part of the Internet, Google transfers around 60 petabytes per month: 60,000,000,000 megabytes! • Now you know why Web search is expensive…
Web Traffic and Bandwidth

• We have seen: Web search is complicated and expensive – Exception: Local search functionality for a single Web site • You cannot run a Web search engine for free – Hardware, traffic, development, … • What could be a reasonable business model here? – Advertising model – Subscription model – Community model – Infomediary model
Business Models
23Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
Business model: The method of doing business by which a company can sustain itself, i.e., generate revenue
• The advertising model – You get paid for showing other people’s ads on your search result pages – Used by Google and most other search engines – To make this work, your search engine must attract a lot of people and placement of ads must be personalized – If your search engine fails at the former, there are other ways: In Microsoft’s “Live Search cashback” program, people earn some money if they buy products found via Live Search’s ads
Business Models (2)
24Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• The subscription model – Customers pay for using your search engine – To make this work, your search engine must be really good – More popular: Rent your technology to other companies; many search engines use this model – Example: t-online.de’s search functionality is provided by Google
Business Models (3)
25Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• The community model – Let users participate in product development – This lowers costs and often increases product quality – Pay your bills by ads and donations – Example: Wikia Search, in which users can directly annotate or even modify search results (discontinued in May 2009)
Business Models (4)
26Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• The infomediary model – Users can use your search engine for free but agree to participate in “market studies” – The users’ search behavior is analyzed to yield individual “user profiles” and to distill overall search trends – This information is sold to other companies, which can use it to optimize their own advertizing strategies – This model usually comes along with severe legal issues regarding the users’ privacy – Examples: No search engine would tell about…
Business Models (5)
27Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• Google’s ad program is called AdWords • It’s very successful – 99% of Google’s revenue is derived from its advertising programs – In 2007, Google had 1 million advertisers 2003: 089,000 2005: 360,000 2004: 201,000 2006: 600,000 – In 2007, on average, each advertiser spent $16,000 a year on Google ads – In 2012, Google earned $42.5 billion with ads

Google’s Business Model
28Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• How it works… – Advertisers: 1. Identify bidding keywords and price 2. Create groupings of keywords and ads
– Upon a search query, google initiates an auction with: 1. Most relevant keyword 2. Maximum specified bid 3. Associated Ad
Google’s Business Model (2)
29Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• During Auction, google looks at: 1. Maximum Bid                        2. Quality Score
• Ranking is given as follows Ad Rank = Maximum Bid x Quality Score • Advertiser is charged with the second highest bid. • As of November 2013, formula was updated Ad Rank =  Max. Bid x Quality Score x Expected Impact from Ad extensions
Ad Rank

• There are cheaper ways than AdWords to get your page on Google’s result pages… • Just let your page look as if it would be highly relevant… • The general term for such techniques is “spamdexing”
Spam

• In 2002, (Fetterly et al., 2004) crawled a set of around 151 million  HTML pages once every week, over a span of 11 weeks • Amongst others, they tried to answer the following questions: – How large is a Web page (measured in bytes)? – How large is a Web page (measured in words)? – How much does a Web page change (within a week)?
Properties of Web Pages

37Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• In 1993, measuring the Web’s size has been easy – Every web page corresponded to a file on some server – There was almost no duplicate content – There was no spam – Most Web servers have been known explicitly
• Estimation of 1993: – 100 servers – 200,000 documents – 4,000,000 pages
• Today, estimating the Web’s size is more difficult

How to handle sites that require users to login?
• Now, what pages should be counted? – Duplicates: Ignore them! – Spam: Ignore it! – Dynamic Web pages (e.g. database interfaces): Count them but try to focus on the actual information; maybe it is better to count in megabytes instead of pages… – (More or less public) private pages: Count them if they can be accessed by a large number of people • Well, now we have defined what should be counted • But… How to do it?

43Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• How to find all Web pages? – Just follow the links… • What about pages nobody links to? • How to detect duplicates? • How to detect spam? • How to crawl Web sites with dynamic pages? • How to access (more or less public) private pages?
How Large is the Web? (7)
44Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
A lot of interesting questions to be solved by Web crawlers and indexers! Let’s answer them next week…
• Let’s assume for now, that we have some Web crawler that can automatically solve all these problems as good as currently possible • Then, calculating the Web’s size is easy: Simply crawl the complete Web and count its number of pages or its size in megabytes! • Bad news: This doesn’t work due to the Web’s enormous size – It would either take forever or require an enormous effort – The Web has changed completely until the crawl is finished • Any better ideas?
How Large is the Web? (8)
45Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• A better approach is called “mark and recapture”: Take two (large) random samples of the Web and compute the Web’s total size by looking at the overlap • Idea: – Let f be the number of pages found in the first crawl – Let s be the number of pages found in the second crawl – Let b be the number of pages found in both crawls – Then, the probability of finding a page from the first crawl by randomly choosing a single Web page is about b / s – On the other hand, this probability is about f / t, where t denotes the (unknown) total number of Web pages – Taken together, we get t = f · s / b
How Large is the Web? (9)
46Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• In practice, one takes random samples from the index of different search engines • Of course, we cannot assume anymore that these draws have been independent • There are more advanced methods to account for this…
• In 2005, the Web has been estimated to contain at least 11.5 billion pages • Nobody knows exactly…
How Large is the Web? (10)
47Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• Of course, these estimates only cover the so-called “surface web,” i.e., the part of the Web that can be accessed automatically by current Web crawlers – Even today’s best Web crawlers cannot find pages without in-links or all pages that have been generated dynamically… • The term “Deep Web” refers to all web pages that currently are not indexed by any Web search engine • There are different estimates on the Deep Web’s size – The Deep Web is 15-500x as large as the surface Web
How Large is the Web? (11)
48Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
Some types of “deep resources”: – Dynamic content that cannot be accessed automatically, e.g. pages that are generated dynamically after filling out Web forms – Unlinked or private content – “Scripted” content, which requires code execution (e.g. Java, JavaScript, or Flash) – “Strange” file formats not handled by current search engines
How Large is the Web? (12)
49Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
• We can view the static Web consisting of static HTML pages together with the hyperlinks between them as a directed graph – Each Web page is a node – Each hyperlink is a directed edge • The hyperlinks into a page are called in-links • The hyperlinks out of a page are called out-links
The Web Graph
50Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines — Wolf-Tilo Balke and José Pinto — Technische Universität Braunschweig
A
B
out-link of page A in-link of page B
• There is evidence that these links are not randomly distributed • The distribution of in-links seems to follow a power law – The total number of pages having exactly k in-links is proportional to 1 / k2.1 • Furthermore, several studies have suggested that the Web graph has a bowtie shape:

Google
• Several studies analyzed users’ query behavior: – The average length of a query is 2.4 terms – About half of all queries consist of a single term – About half of the users looked only at the first 20 results – Less than 5% of users use advanced search features (e.g., Boolean operators) – About 20% of all queries contain a geographic term – About a third of the queries from the same user were repeated queries; about 90% of the time the user would click on the same result – Term frequency distributions conform to the power law
