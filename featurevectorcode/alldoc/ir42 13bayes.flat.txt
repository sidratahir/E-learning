Relevance feedback: Basic idea

The user issues a (short, simple) query. The search engine returns a set of documents. User marks some docs as relevant, some as nonrelevant. Search engine computes a new representation of the information need ? should be better than the initial query. Search engine runs new query and returns new results. New results have (hopefully) better recall.

Types of query expansion

Manual thesaurus (maintained by editors, e.g., PubMed) Automatically derived thesaurus (e.g., based on co-occurrence statistics) Query-equivalence based on query log mining (common on the web as in the ?palm? example)

Query expansion at search engines

Main source of query expansion at search engines: query logs Example 1: After issuing the query [herbs], users frequently search for [herbal remedies].
? ?herbal remedies? is potential expansion of ?herb?.

Example 2: Users searching for [?ower pix] frequently click on the URL photobucket.com/?ower. Users searching for [?ower clipart] frequently click on the same URL.
? ??ower clipart? and ??ower pix? are potential expansions of each other.

Formal de?nition of TC: Training
Given: A document space X
Documents are represented in this space ? typically some type of high-dimensional space.

A ?xed set of classes C = {c1 , c2 , . . . , cJ }
The classes are human-de?ned for the needs of an application (e.g., spam vs. nonspam).

A training set D of labeled documents. Each labeled document d, c ? X ? C Using a learning method or learning algorithm, we then wish to learn a classi?er ? that maps documents to classes: ?:X?C

Examples of how search engines use classi?cation

Language identi?cation (classes: English vs. French etc.) The automatic detection of spam pages (spam vs. nonspam) Sentiment detection: is a movie or product review positive or negative (positive vs. negative) Topic-speci?c or vertical search ? restrict search to a ?vertical? like ?related to health? (relevant to vertical vs. not)

Classi?cation methods: 1. Manual

Manual classi?cation was used by Yahoo in the beginning of the web. Also: ODP, PubMed Very accurate if job is done by experts Consistent when the problem size and team is small Scaling manual classi?cation is di?cult and expensive. ? We need automatic methods for classi?cation.

16 / 58

Classi?cation methods: 2. Rule-based

E.g., Google Alerts is rule-based classi?cation. There are IDE-type development enviroments for writing very complex rules e?ciently. (e.g., Verity) Often: Boolean combinations (as in Google Alerts) Accuracy is very high if a rule has been carefully re?ned over time by a subject expert. Building and maintaining rule-based classi?cation systems is cumbersome and expensive.

Classi?cation methods: 3. Statistical/Probabilistic

This was our de?nition of the classi?cation problem ? text classi?cation as a learning problem (i) Supervised learning of a the classi?cation function ? and (ii) application of ? to classifying new documents We will look at two methods for doing this: Naive Bayes and SVMs No free lunch: requires hand-classi?ed training data But this manual classi?cation can be done by non-experts.

The Naive Bayes classi?er
The Naive Bayes classi?er is a probabilistic classi?er. We compute the probability of a document d being in a class c as follows: P(c|d) ? P(c)
1?k?nd

P(tk |c)

nd is the length of the document. (number of tokens) P(tk |c) is the conditional probability of term tk occurring in a document of class c P(tk |c) as a measure of how much evidence tk contributes that c is the correct class. P(c) is the prior probability of c. If a document?s terms do not provide clear evidence for one class vs. another, we choose the c with highest P(c).
21 / 58

Maximum a posteriori class

Our goal in Naive Bayes classi?cation is to ?nd the ?best? class. The best class is the most likely or maximum a posteriori (MAP) class c map : ? ? c map = arg max P(c|d) = arg max P(c)
c?C c?C 1?k?nd

? P(tk |c)

22 / 58

Taking the log

Multiplying lots of small probabilities can result in ?oating point under?ow. Since log(xy ) = log(x) + log(y ), we can sum log probabilities instead of multiplying probabilities. Since log is a monotonic function, the class with the highest score does not change. So what we usually compute in practice is: ? c map = arg max [log P(c) +
c?C 1?k?nd

? log P(tk |c)]

23 / 58

Naive Bayes classi?er

Classi?cation rule: ? c map = arg max [log P(c) +
c?C 1?k?nd

? log P(tk |c)]

Simple interpretation:
? Each conditional parameter log P(tk |c) is a weight that indicates how good an indicator tk is for c. ? The prior log P(c) is a weight that indicates the relative frequency of c. The sum of log prior and term weights is then a measure of how much evidence there is for the document being in the class. We select the class with the most evidence.

24 / 58

Parameter estimation take 1: Maximum likelihood
? ? Estimate parameters P(c) and P(tk |c) from train data: How? Prior: Nc ? P(c) = N Nc : number of docs in class c; N: total number of docs Conditional probabilities: ? P(t|c) = Tct
t ? ?V

Tct ?

Tct is the number of tokens of t in training documents from class c (includes multiple occurrences) We?ve made a Naive Bayes independence assumption here: ? ? P(tk |c) = P(tk |c), independent of position
25 / 58

The problem with maximum likelihood estimates: Zeros
C =China

X1 =Beijing

X2 =and

X3 =Taipei

X4 =join

X5 =WTO

P(China|d) ? P(China) ? P(Beijing|China) ? P(and|China) ? P(Taipei|China) ? P(join|China) ? P(WTO|China)

If WTO never occurs in class China in the train set: ? P(WTO|China) = TChina,WTO
t ? ?V

TChina,t ?

=
t ? ?V

0 =0 TChina,t ?
26 / 58

The problem with maximum likelihood estimates: Zeros (cont)

If there are no occurrences of WTO in documents in class China, we get a zero estimate: ? P(WTO|China) = TChina,WTO
t ? ?V

TChina,t ?

=0

? We will get P(China|d) = 0 for any document that contains WTO!

27 / 58

To avoid zeros: Add-one smoothing

Before: ? P(t|c) =

Tct
t ? ?V

Tct ? Tct + 1 t ? ?V Tct ? ) + B

Now: Add one to each count to avoid zeros: ? P(t|c) = Tct + 1 = ( t ? ?V (Tct ? + 1)

B is the number of bins ? in this case the number of di?erent words or the size of the vocabulary |V | = M

Example: Parameter estimates

? ? Priors: P(c) = 3/4 and P(c) = 1/4 Conditional probabilities: ? P(Chinese|c) = (5 + 1)/(8 + 6) = 6/14 = 3/7 ? ? P(Tokyo|c) = P(Japan|c) = (0 + 1)/(8 + 6) = 1/14 ? P(Chinese|c) = (1 + 1)/(3 + 6) = 2/9 ? ? P(Tokyo|c) = P(Japan|c) = (1 + 1)/(3 + 6) = 2/9 The denominators are (8 + 6) and (3 + 6) because the lengths of textc and textc are 8 and 3, respectively, and because the constant B is 6 as the vocabulary consists of six terms.

34 / 58

Example: Classi?cation

? P(c|d5 ) ? 3/4 ? (3/7)3 ? 1/14 ? 1/14 ? 0.0003 ? P(c|d5 ) ? 1/4 ? (2/9)3 ? 2/9 ? 2/9 ? 0.0001 Thus, the classi?er assigns the test document to c = China. The reason for this classi?cation decision is that the three occurrences of the positive indicator Chinese in d5 outweigh the occurrences of the two negative indicators Japan and Tokyo.

35 / 58

Time complexity of Naive Bayes
mode time complexity training ?(|D|Lave + |C||V |) testing ?(La + |C|M a ) = ?(|C|M a ) Lave : average length of a training doc, La : length of the test doc, M a : number of distinct terms in the test doc, D: training set, V : vocabulary, C: set of classes ?(|D|Lave ) is the time it takes to compute all counts. ?(|C||V |) is the time it takes to compute the parameters from the counts. Generally: |C||V | < |D|Lave Test time is also linear (in the length of the test document). Thus: Naive Bayes is linear in the size of the training set (training) and the test document (testing). This is optimal.

Naive Bayes: Analysis

Now we want to gain a better understanding of the properties of Naive Bayes. We will formally derive the classi?cation rule . . . . . . and make our assumptions explicit.

38 / 58

Derivation of Naive Bayes rule
We want to ?nd the class that is most likely given the document: c map = arg max P(c|d)
c?C

Apply Bayes rule P(A|B) =

P(B|A)P(A) : P(B)

c map = arg max
c?C

P(d|c)P(c) P(d)

Drop denominator since P(d) is the same for all classes: c map = arg max P(d|c)P(c)
c?C

39 / 58

Too many parameters / sparseness

c map = arg max P(d|c)P(c)
c?C

= arg max P( t1 , . . . , tk , . . . , tnd |c)P(c)
c?C

There are too many parameters P( t1 , . . . , tk , . . . , tnd |c), one for each unique combination of a class and a sequence of words. We would need a very, very large number of training examples to estimate that many parameters. This is the problem of data sparseness.

40 / 58

Naive Bayes conditional independence assumption

To reduce the number of parameters to a manageable size, we make the Naive Bayes conditional independence assumption: P(d|c) = P( t1 , . . . , tnd |c) =
1?k?nd

P(Xk = tk |c)

We assume that the probability of observing the conjunction of attributes is equal to the product of the individual probabilities P(Xk = tk |c). Recall from earlier the estimates for these +1 ? conditional probabilities: P(t|c) = ( ? TctT ? )+B
t ?V ct

41 / 58

Generative model
C =China

X1 =Beijing

X2 =and

X3 =Taipei

X4 =join

X5 =WTO

P(c|d) ? P(c)

1?k?nd

P(tk |c)

Generate a class with probability P(c) Generate each of the words (in their respective positions), conditional on the class, but independent of each other, with probability P(tk |c) To classify docs, we ?reengineer? this process and ?nd the class that is most likely to have generated the doc.
42 / 58

Second independence assumption

? ? P(Xk1 = t|c) = P(Xk2 = t|c) For example, for a document in the class UK, the probability of generating queen in the ?rst position of the document is the same as generating it in the last position. The two independence assumptions amount to the bag of words model.

43 / 58

A di?erent Naive Bayes model: Bernoulli model
C =China

U Alaska =0

U Beijing =1

U India =0

U join =1

U Taipei =1

U WTO =1

44 / 58

Violation of Naive Bayes independence assumptions
Conditional independence: P( t1 , . . . , tnd |c) =
1?k?nd

P(Xk = tk |c)

Positional independence: ? ? P(Xk = t|c) = P(Xk = t|c)
1 2

The independence assumptions do not really hold of documents written in natural language. Exercise
Examples for why conditional independence assumption is not really true? Examples for why positional independence assumption is not really true?

How can Naive Bayes work if it makes such inappropriate assumptions?
45 / 58

Why does Naive Bayes work?
Naive Bayes can work well even though conditional independence assumptions are badly violated. Example: c1 0.6 0.00099 0.99 Double counting of evidence causes and overestimation (0.99). true probability P(c|d) ? ? P(c) 1?k?nd P(tk |c) ? NB estimate P(c|d) c2 class selected 0.4 c1 0.00001 0.01 c1 underestimation (0.01)

Classi?cation is about predicting the correct class and not about accurately estimating probabilities. Naive Bayes is terrible for correct estimation . . . . . . but if often performs well at accurate prediction (choosing the correct class).
46 / 58

Naive Bayes is not so naive
Naive Bayes has won some bakeo?s (e.g., KDD-CUP 97) More robust to nonrelevant features than some more complex learning methods More robust to concept drift (changing of de?nition of class over time) than some more complex learning methods Better than methods like decision trees when we have many equally important features A good dependable baseline for text classi?cation (but not the best) Optimal if independence assumptions hold (never true for text, but true for some domains) Very fast Low storage requirements

Evaluating classi?cation

Evaluation must be done on test data that are independent of the training data, i.e., training and test sets are disjoint. It?s easy to get good performance on a test set that was available to the learner during training (e.g., just memorize the test set). Measures: Precision, recall, F1 , classi?cation accuracy

52 / 58

Precision P and recall R

predicted to be in the class predicted to not be in the class

in the class true positives (TP) false negatives (FN)

not in the class false positives (FP) true negatives (TN)

TP, FP, FN, TN are counts of documents. The sum of these four counts is the total number of documents. precision:P recall:R = TP/(TP + FP) = TP/(TP + FN)

F1 allows us to trade o? precision against recall. F1 =

This is the harmonic mean of P and R:

Averaging: Micro vs. Macro

We now have an evaluation measure (F1 ) for one class. But we also want a single number that measures the aggregate performance over all classes in the collection. Macroaveraging
Compute F1 for each of the C classes Average these C numbers

Microaveraging
Compute TP, FP, FN for each of the C classes Sum these C numbers (e.g., all TP to get aggregate TP) Compute F1 for aggregate TP, FP, FN
