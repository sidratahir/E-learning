Introduction to Database Systems Motivation

Werner Nutt

Databases Are Everywhere
? Database = a large (?) collection of related data ? Classically, a DB models a real-world organisation (e.g., enterprise, university) ? Entities (e.g., students, courses) ? Relationships (e.g., ?Martin is taking IDS in 2010/11?) ? Changes in the organisation = changes in the database ? Examples: ? personnel records ? banking ? airline reservations

Scientific Databases (Examples)
? Biology: e.g., DNA sequences of genes, amino-acid sequences of proteins, genes expressed in tissues (up to several Gigabytes) ? Astronomy: e.g., location and spectra of astronomic objects (up to several Terabytes) ? Physics: e.g., sensor measurements in particle physics experiments (up to several Petabytes)
3

DB Tendencies
? Sensors record data DBs grow in size DBs become more widespread date may be less reliable, i.e., uncertain ? Multimedia data Requirements for larger storage New query operations (e.g., find a song by humming the melody, find pictures with a given face) ? Data on the Web Accessed/changed by many people (Facebook,?) Speed up access, loosen consistency (NoSQL)
4

Operations with Databases
? Design ? Define structure and types of data ? Construction ? Create data structures of DB, populate DB with data ? Manipulation of Data ? Insert, delete, update ? Query: ?Which department pays the highest salary?? ? Create reports: ?List monthly salaries of employees, organised by department, with average salary and total sum of salaries for each dept?
5

An Ideal DB Implementation Should Support:
? Structure ? data types ? data behaviour ? Persistence ? store data on secondary storage ? Retrieval ? a declarative query language ? a procedural database programming language ? Performance ? retrieve and store data quickly ? Data Integrity ? Sharing ? concurrency ? Reliability and resilience ? Large data volumes

6

Database Management System (DBMS)
? A DBMS is a software package designed to store and manage databases ? A DBMS provides generic functionality (see previous slide) that otherwise would have to be implemented over and over again
Reduced application development time

? Several brands, e.g.,
? Oracle Xi/Yg (Oracle), DB2 (IBM), SQL Server, Access (Microsoft), MySQL, PostgreSQL, HSQLDB, SQLite (open source)

File System Approach
? Uncontrolled redundancy ? Inconsistent data ? Inflexibility ? Limited data sharing ? Poor enforcement of standards ? Low programmer productivity ? Excessive program maintenance ? Excessive data maintenance

13

DBMS Approach
? Controlled redundancy ? consistency of data & integrity constraints ? Integration of data ? self-contained ? represents semantics of application ? Data and operation sharing ? multiple interfaces ? Services & controls ? security & privacy controls ? backup & recovery ? enforcement of standards ? Flexibility ? data independence ? data accessibility ? reduced program maintenance ? Ease of application development

14

However....
If an application is ? simple ? stringent real-time ? single user ? static, files are the option of choice DBMS downside: ? more expensive ? more complex ? general

Summary:
? In a file system, data is physically accessed and not integrated ? In a DBMS, data is logically accessed and integrated: ? query language ? data dictionary
